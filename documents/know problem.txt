This application, as regards Nuget packages, is corrupt.  I deduce this
since the problem occurred under Visual Studio 2010 and 2015 and
remained after a re-install of Visual Studio 2015.

The app once had a solution inside the code directory and now has one
outside of it.  Either way, the problem persisted.  

Attempts to update packages from Nuget all hang.  Attempts to upgrade
from MVC 3 to MVC 4 failed due to this.  An attempt to create a new MVC 4
app and port over the old code was a can of worms that hung up on accessing
the Entity Framework elements "Table" and "Schema".

I wasted 2 days on this and have now declared upgrading any aspect of this
application to be frozen.

NOTE: MVC is, itself, a can of worms and the DLLs have moved around in
ownership, from "public" (?) to "microsoft"...

There is a lot NOT to like about MVC, not least all this bullshit.

Intellisense error: The "packages" element is not declared

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<packages>

  <package id="Modernizr" version="1.7" />
</packages>

NOTE: The MVC objects "@model" and "@ViewBag" also show intellisense
errors yet the program still works.  This is, probably, since I have the DLLs.
The "corruption" may just extend to intellisense....
